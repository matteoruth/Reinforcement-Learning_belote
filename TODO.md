## 1. Define and Refine the Rules:
  Creating a comprehensive document describing the rules, including specific actions, card values, and game mechanics.
  Considering any additional features or variations we may want to incorporate.
  
## 2. Design the Game Framework:
  Designing the data structures and algorithms needed to handle the game logic efficiently.
  Deciding on the appropriate programming language and libraries/frameworks to build your application.
 
## 3. Implement a Random Agent:
  Developing a basic agent that plays randomly, adhering to the rules of the game.
  Creating a framework for evaluating the agent's performance, such as win rate or average score.

## 4. Create a Game Environment:
  Building the game environment where agents can play against each other.
  Setting up the necessary infrastructure to manage the game state, player actions, and turn-based gameplay.
  Incorporating rule enforcement to ensure agents' actions are valid and follow the game rules.

## 5. Collect Training Data:
  Generating a large dataset of game states and corresponding actions, using the random agent to play against itself or other random agents.
  Annotate the data with the correct actions for each game state.

## 6. Train the Intelligent Agent:
  Looking for a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm (deep Q-learning or policy gradients)
  Setting up the training pipeline, including data preprocessing, model architecture, and hyperparameter tuning.
  Training the agent
  
## 7. Evaluate and Improve the Agent:
   Assess the performance by playing against it
